<h1>A Lustrous Pinnacle of Hollywood Glamour</h1>

<div id="articleBody">
  <p> <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/1547611/Elizabeth-Taylor?inline=nyt-per" title="">Elizabeth Taylor</a>,
   the actress who dazzled generations of moviegoers with her stunning  
 beauty and whose name was synonymous with Hollywood glamour, died on   
Wednesday in Los Angeles. She was 79. </p>
  <p> A spokeswoman at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center said Ms. Taylor died 
at   1:28 a.m. Pacific time. Her publicist, Sally Morrison, said the 
cause   was complications of congestive heart failure. Ms. Taylor had 
had a   series of medical setbacks over the years and was hospitalized 
six weeks   ago with heart problems. </p>

  </p>
  <p> In a world of flickering images, Elizabeth Taylor was a constant 
star.   First appearing on screen at age 10, she grew up there, never 
passing   through an awkward age. It was one quick leap from <a title="Trailer for the film." href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NYsONLJUTQ">“National Velvet”</a> to <a title="Trailer for the film." href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Fm6sa_L5_4">“A Place in the Sun”</a> and from there to<a title="Trailer for the film." href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGDyZHlHklo"> “Cleopatra,”</a> as she was indelibly transformed from a vulnerable child actress into a voluptuous film queen. </p>
  <p> In a career of some 70 years and more than 50 films, she won two 
Academy   Awards as best actress, for her performances as a call girl in
   “BUtterfield 8” (1960) and as the<a title="A scene from the film" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nInE5TITzE8"> acid-tongued Martha</a> in “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” (1966). <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/104435/Mike-Nichols?inline=nyt-per" title="">Mike Nichols</a>, who directed her in “Virginia Woolf,” said he considered her “one of the greatest cinema actresses.” </p>

   Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times, “More than anyone else I 
can   think of, Elizabeth Taylor represents the complete movie 
phenomenon —   what movies are as an art and an industry, and what they 
have meant to   those of us who have grown up watching them in the 
dark.</p>

  <p> Ms. Taylor’s popularity endured throughout her life, but critics 
were   sometimes reserved in their praise of her acting. In that sense 
she may   have been upstaged by her own striking beauty. Could anyone as
 lovely as   Elizabeth Taylor also be talented? The answer, of course, 
was yes. </p>
  <p> Given her lack of professional training, the range of her acting 
was   surprisingly wide. She played predatory vixens and wounded 
victims. She   was Cleopatra of the burnished barge; <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/1286086/Tennessee-Williams?inline=nyt-per" title="">Tennessee Williams</a>’s Maggie the cat; Catherine Holly, who confronted terror suddenly last summer; and <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/314726/William-Shakespeare?inline=nyt-per" title="">Shakespeare</a>’s Kate. Her melodramatic heroines would have been at home on soap operas. </p>

  <p>Joseph L.

   saw her for the first time, in Cannes, when she was 18. “She was the 
  most incredible vision of loveliness I have ever seen in my life,” he 
  said. “And she was sheer innocence.”</p>
  <p> Mankiewicz admired her professionalism. “Whatever the script 
called for,   she played it,” he said. “The thread that goes through the
 whole is   that of a woman who is an honest performer. Therein lies her
 identity.” </p>
  <p> It was also Mankiewicz who said that for Ms. Taylor, “living life 
was a   kind of acting,” that she lived her life “in screen time.” </p>

  <p> <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/1030054/Marilyn-Monroe?inline=nyt-per" title="">Marilyn Monroe</a> was the sex goddess, <a title="Times slideshow on " href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/05/03/fashion/20100503-grace-slideshow_index.html">Grace Kelly</a> the ice queen, <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/31869/Audrey-Hepburn?inline=nyt-per" title="">Audrey Hepburn</a> the eternal gamine. Ms. Taylor was beauty incarnate. As the director George Stevens said when he chose her for “<a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/gst/movies/titlelist.html?v_idlist=435702;106181;38269&amp;inline=nyt_ttl">A Place in the Sun</a>,”
   the role called for the “beautiful girl in the yellow Cadillac   
convertible that every American boy, some time or other, thinks he can  
 marry.” </p>
  <p> There was more than a touch of Ms. Taylor herself in the roles she
   played. She acted with the magnet of her personality. Although she 
could   alter her look for a part — putting on weight for Martha in 
“Virginia   Woolf” or wearing elaborate period costumes — she was not a 
chameleon,   assuming the coloration of a character. Instead she would 
bring the   character closer to herself. For her, acting was “purely 
intuitive.” As   she said, “What I try to do is to give the maximum 
emotional effect with   the minimum of visual movement.” </p>

  <p> Sometimes her film roles seemed to be a mirror image of her life. 
More   than most movie stars, she seemed to exist in the public domain. 
She was   pursued by paparazzi and denounced by the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/r/roman_catholic_church/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about the Roman Catholic Church.">Vatican</a>.
   But behind the seemingly scandalous behavior was a woman with a clear
   sense of morality: she habitually married her lovers. People watched 
and   counted, with vicarious pleasure, as she became Elizabeth Taylor 
Hilton   Wilding Todd Fisher Burton Burton Warner Fortensky — enough 
marriages   to certify her career as a serial wife. Asked why she 
married so often,   she said, in an assumed drawl: “I don’t know, honey.
 It sure beats the   hell out of me.” </p>

  </p>
  <p>In a lifetime of emotional and physical setbacks, serious illnesses
 and   accidents, and several near-death experiences, Ms. Taylor was a  
 survivor. “I’ve been lucky all my life,” she said just before turning  
 60. “Everything was handed to me. Looks, fame, wealth, honors, love. I 
  rarely had to fight for anything. But I’ve paid for that luck with   
disasters.” At 65, she said on the ABC program “20/20”: “I’m like a   
living example of what people can go through and survive. I’m not like  
 anyone. I’m me.” </p>
  <p> Her life was played out in print: miles of newspaper and magazine 
  articles, a galaxy of photographs and a shelf of biographies, each one
   painting a different portrait. “Planes, trains, everything stops for 
  Elizabeth Taylor, but the public has no conception of who she is,” 
said <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/47310/Roddy-McDowall?inline=nyt-per" title="">Roddy McDowall</a>,
   who was one of her earliest co-stars and a friend for life. “People 
who   damn her wish to hell they could do what they think she does.” </p>

  <p> There was one point of general agreement: her beauty. As cameramen
   noted, her face was flawlessly symmetrical; she had no bad angle, and
   her eyes were of the deepest violet. </p>
  <p> One prominent and perhaps surprising dissenter about her looks was <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/83664/Richard-Burton?inline=nyt-per" title="">Richard Burton</a>,
   who was twice her husband. The notion of his wife as “the most   
beautiful woman in the world is absolute nonsense,” he said. “She has   
wonderful eyes,” he added, “but she has a double chin and an   
overdeveloped chest, and she’s rather short in the leg.” </p>

  <p> On screen and off, Ms. Taylor was a provocative combination of the
 angel   and the seductress. In all her incarnations she had a vibrant  
 sensuality. But beneath it was more than a tinge of vulgarity, as in 
her   love of showy jewelry. “I know I’m vulgar,” she said, addressing 
her   fans with typical candor, “but would you have me any other way?” </p>

  </p>
  <p> For many years she was high on the list of box-office stars. Even 
when   her movies were unsuccessful, or, late in her career, when she 
acted   infrequently, she retained her fame: there was only one Liz (a 
nickname   she hated), and her celebrity increased the more she lived in
 the public   eye. There was nothing she could do about it. “The public 
me,” she   said, “the one named Elizabeth Taylor, has become a lot of 
hokum and   fabrication — a bunch of drivel — and I find her slightly 
revolting.” </p>
  <p> Late in life she became a social activist. After her friend <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/33748/Rock-Hudson?inline=nyt-per" title="">Rock Hudson</a>
 died, she helped establish the American Foundation for AIDS Research   
and helped raise money for it. In 1997, she said, “I use my fame now   
when I want to help a cause or other people.” </p>

  <p> In a life of many surprises, one of the oddest facts is that as an
   infant she was considered to be an ugly duckling. Elizabeth Rosemond 
  Taylor was born in London on Feb. 27, 1932, the second child of 
American   parents with roots in Kansas. Her father, Francis Lenn 
Taylor, was an   art dealer who had been transferred to London from New 
York; her mother,   the former Sara Viola Warmbrodt, had acted in the 
theater in New York,   under the name Sara Sothern, before she was 
married. (Her brother,   Howard, was born in 1929.) At birth, her mother
 said, her daughter’s   “tiny face was so tightly closed it looked as if
 it would never unfold.” </p>
  <p> Elizabeth spent her early childhood in England. It was there, at 
3, that   she learned to ride horseback, a skill that helped her win her
 first   major role. Just before World War II, the family moved to the 
United   States, eventually settling in Beverly Hills. </p>

  <p> <strong>16 An Inauspicious Start</strong></p>
  <p> Ms. Taylor’s mother shared with her daughter a love of movies and 
  encouraged her to act. Elizabeth made her movie debut in 1942 as 
Gloria   Twine in a forgettable film called “<a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/113206/There-s-One-Born-Every-Minute/overview">There’s One Born Every Minute</a>,” with Carl Switzer, best known as Alfalfa, the boy with the cowlick in the “<a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/gst/movies/titlelist.html?v_idlist=447729;149774&amp;inline=nyt_ttl">Our Gang</a>”
   series. The casting director at Universal said of her: “The kid has  
 nothing.” Despite that inauspicious debut, Sam Marx, an MGM producer 
who   had known the Taylors in England, arranged for their daughter to 
have a   screen test for “<a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/28268/Lassie-Come-Home/overview">Lassie Come Home</a>.”
   She passed the audition. During the filming, in which Ms. Taylor 
acted   with Roddy McDowall, a cameraman mistakenly thought her long 
eyelashes   were fake and asked her to take them off. </p>

  <p>The power of her attraction was evident as early as 1944, in “<a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/34594/National-Velvet/overview">National Velvet</a>.”
   MGM had for many years owned the film rights to the Enid Bagnold 
novel   on which that film was based but had had difficulty finding a 
child   actress who could speak with an English accent and ride horses. 
At 12,   Elizabeth Taylor met those requirements, though she was 
initially   rejected for being too short. Stories circulated that she 
stretched   herself in order to fill the physical dimensions of the 
role: Velvet   Brown, a girl who was obsessed with horses and rode one 
to victory in   the Grand National Steeplechase. “I knew if it were 
right for me to be   Velvet,” she said, “God would make me grow.” </p>

  <p> In one scene her horse, which she called the Pie, seemed to be 
dying,   and Ms. Taylor was supposed to cry — the first time she was 
called on to   show such emotion on screen. Her co-star was <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/108826/Mickey-Rooney?inline=nyt-per" title="">Mickey Rooney</a>,
   a more experienced actor, and he gave her some advice on how to 
summon   tears: pretend that her father was dying, that her mother had 
to wash   clothes for a living and that her little dog had been run 
over. Hearing   that sad scenario, Ms. Taylor burst out laughing at the 
absurdity. When   it came time to shoot the scene, she later said: “All I
 thought about   was the horse being very sick and that I was the little

  <p>Ms. Taylor gave a performance that, quite literally, made grown men
 and   women weep, to say nothing of girls who identified with Velvet. 
In his   review of the film in The Nation, James Agee, otherwise a 
tough-minded   critic, confessed that the first time he had seen Ms. 
Taylor on screen   he had been “choked with the peculiar sort of 
adoration I might have   felt if we were both in the same grade of 
primary school.”</p>

  <p> She was, he said, “rapturously beautiful.” </p>
  <p> “I think that she and the picture are wonderful, and I hardly know or care whether she can act or not.” </p>
  <p> The movie made her a star. Decades later she said “National 
Velvet” was   still “the most exciting film” she had ever made. But 
there was a   drawback. To do the movie she had to sign a long-term 
contract with MGM.   As she said, she “became their chattel until I did 
‘Cleopatra.’&nbsp;” </p>

  <p> At first she played typical teenagers (in “<a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/29266/Life-With-Father/overview">Life With Father</a>,” “A Date With Judy” and “<a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/gst/movies/titlelist.html?v_idlist=133561;99898;205971;29696;127071;29695;29697;133095;29694&amp;inline=nyt_ttl">Little Women</a>”).
   At 16 she was “an emotional child inside a woman’s body,” she later  
 said. But in contrast to other child actresses, she made an easy   
transition to adult roles. In 1950 she played <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/113772/Robert-Taylor?inline=nyt-per" title="">Robert Taylor</a>’s wife in “<a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/10838/Conspirator/overview">Conspirator</a>.” The same year, she was in <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/103002/Vincente-Minnelli?inline=nyt-per" title="">Vincente Minnelli</a>’s “<a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/gst/movies/titlelist.html?v_idlist=16919;16920&amp;inline=nyt_ttl">Father of the Bride</a>,” with <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/71578/Spencer-Tracy?inline=nyt-per" title="">Spencer Tracy</a>.
   And, life imitating art, she became a bride herself in 1950, marrying
   the hotel heir Conrad N. Hilton Jr., who was known as Nicky. After an
   unhappy nine months, she divorced him and then married the British 
actor   Michael Wilding, who was 20 years older than she. </p>

  <p> By her own estimation, she “whistled and hummed” her way through 
her   early films. But that changed in 1951, when she made “A Place in 
the   Sun,” playing her prototypical role as a seemingly unattainable 
romantic   vision. The film, she said, was “the first time I ever 
considered <em>acting</em> when I was young.” </p>
  <p> In the film she plays a wealthy young woman of social position who is the catalyst for <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/13682/Montgomery-Clift?inline=nyt-per" title="">Montgomery Clift</a>’s American tragedy. To the astonishment of skeptics, she held her own with Clift and Shelley Winters. </p>

   (with Clift, who became a close friend). Her role in “Raintree 
County”   (1957), as Susanna Drake, a Civil-War era Southern belle who 
marries an   Indiana abolitionist, earned her an Oscar nomination for 
best actress.   It was the first of four consecutive nominations; the

<p>LET'S PROPOSE a   theory. Nothing too new or radical — it is the 
weekend, after all. Let's   just say there are really only two ways of 
looking at things in this   world: from within, and from without. And 
now that we're done with that,   let's talk about bike messengers. </p>
<p> In case you haven't   been in the urban core of any major American 
city for the past few   decades, bike messengers are those toned, 
tattooed daredevils who cut   through exhaust and traffic all day long 
delivering just about anything   that will fit in their shoulder bags: 
legal documents, settlement   checks, X-rays, tax filings, architectural
 plans, silver flatware the   judge has said must now be passed from the
 lawyers for him to the   lawyers for her. </p>
<p><br clear="all">
  <strong>25. What word does not describe bike messengers?</strong></p>
<p>
  <input name="Submit19" onclick="MM_popupMsg('Wrong, try again!')" value="toned" type="submit">

  <input name="Submit19" onclick="MM_popupMsg('Sorry, Try again.')" value="tattooed" type="submit">
</p>
<p>Who are these people, these men and women who spend their days 
pedaling   inches away from the grills of trucks, swerving around 
shocked   pedestrians and standing, sweaty and smelly and proud of it, 
in   high-rise elevators? </p>
<p></p>
<p> This would seem an   important question to be asking, considering 
that next month, scores of   messengers from around the world are going 
to descend on Seattle for the   Cycle Messenger World Championships, an 
Olympics-style bike-courier   competition. The contests will include 
sprinting, curb-hopping,   cargo-pulling and skidding. </p>

</p>
<p> But it turns out that   when it comes to bike messengers, "Who are 
these people?" is actually   not the most important question to be 
asking. Remember the theory. The   most important question is: Who are <em>you</em>, and where are you looking from?
</p>
<p>PERHAPS YOU ARE looking down from the driver's seat of your big, 
green   Chevy Suburban, as was a rather angry man who, while I was 
working as a   bike messenger in downtown Seattle last summer, pulled up
 alongside me   at a stop light and for no apparent reason began 
yelling: "I hate you   messengers!" </p>

</p>
<p>Perhaps you are   looking out from television sets across the city, 
  as was Ken Schram, the   local pundit who last summer went on air and 
  fulminated against "these   cycle-nazis" who "zip inside two lanes of 
  traffic, run red lights and   stop signs, make illegal turns or 
  terrorize pedestrians on the   sidewalk." </p>
<p> Or perhaps you are   not someone with so loud a voice or so wide an 
audience. Perhaps you are   simply someone who has been frightened by a 
zooming messenger while   walking around downtown, or cut off by a 
messenger while driving, or   flipped off by a messenger, or worse. 
Perhaps you are a pedestrian who   has wound up flat on the sidewalk, 
staring at a haze of bike shoes and   piercings and attitude after being
 hit by a messenger (this does happen,   though no firm statistics exist
 on how often). </p>
<p> You see where we are   going. We are now looking at messengers from 
the outside, from the   perspective that many seem to have, the 
perspective that says messengers   are, as Schram put it, "hazardous and
 menacing." <br clear="all">

</p>
<p>There is, of course, another way to look at messengers. From within —   
  from behind their handlebars, from atop their pedals, the way I looked  
   at messengers last summer.</p>
<p> From June through   September, I worked for the largest Seattle 
messenger company, ABC   Legal. I earned $9 an hour, the starting salary
 but also not far from as   good as the pay gets. I received no health 
benefits. (According to one   of my managers, ABC is one of just two 
companies downtown that offer   some health benefits, but at ABC you 
have to work a year before you get   them.) I rode the hills, delivered 
the packages, raced to the courthouse   to file the last-minute legal 
papers. I was 24, ready for a break from a   writing job, and hearing 
plenty of advice that I was making a huge   mistake. It turned out to be
 the best summer job I ever had. </p>

</p>
<p> For its brooding   workforce of artists, anarchists, office refugees
 and other assorted   misfits, messengering offers the perfect 
antidepressant cocktail: a   daily dose of  endorphins, regular booster 
shots of adrenaline and fresh   air, plus a new mission every 15 
minutes. The sense of accomplishment   is continual. The highs — from 
caffeine, from the sugar in those little   candies at receptionists' 
desks, from illicit substances that some   messengers partake in  —  are
 perpetual. And the deliveries are stamped   "SPECIAL," a fact that 
seeps into your mind after a while. </p>
<p><br clear="all">

</p>
<p>Jeremy, a muscular 23-year-old whose name among messengers has evolved  
 into a simple growl — "Grrr" — once externalized this seepage by   
stamping the word SPECIAL all over his body. He explains the job's   
allure: </p>
<p></p>
<p> "There's not really   that much at this age that would be better . .
 . I've worked office jobs   before, and I know how much an office job 
can suck. You're basically   just sitting doing mundane stuff all day 
under fluorescent lights. That   basically drains your whole will." </p>
<p> Over the summer, I   got to know Grrr and the other "cycle-nazis," 
people mostly in their 20s   who naturally see themselves a bit 
differently than the outside world   does. About 100 messengers rove 
downtown Seattle for about a dozen   companies, and the ones I met saw 
themselves, first of all, as   blue-collar workers doing a physically 
demanding and dangerous job.    They believe in messengering the way 
lawyers or doctors believe in the   excellence of their occupations. </p>

Their reasons vary. Some just love bikes and thrill at the chance to get
   paid to ride them all day. Others see the trade as the perfect   
anti-corporate, anti-establishment hideout. (Welcome to the first of   
many paradoxes in the bike-messenger business: The very existence of   
this anti-corporate, anti-establishment hideout depends upon the   
existence of corporations and establishments that are sending messages.)
   Still other messengers see their work as an in-your-face reminder to 
  the SUV-driving and car-commuting crowd that there is a more   
eco-friendly way to get around. Finally, many messengers believe in   
their job simply because it is the perfect way to earn a little cash and
   get in shape without stressing yourself so much that you can't think 
  about what's really important, which of course is your band or your 
art   (the overlap between bike messengers and band members is 
considerable).
<p></p>
<p> But if messengers   differ as to why they believe in what they do, 
they tend to agree that   their self-image is defined by the hostility 
they often feel from the   world in which they operate. </p>
<p><strong>32. What is not a reason for messengers to work as messengers?</strong></p>
<p>
  <input name="Submit19" onclick="MM_popupMsg('Wrong, try again!')" value="get paid to ride their bike all day" type="submit">

</p>
<p> A few minutes after   that man in the green Suburban yelled at me, I
 crossed paths with Grrr,   whom I looked to as something of a mentor. 
When I told him what had   happened, he said, "You gotta get used to it.
 People don't like us." </p>
<p> SO WE NOW HAVE two   visions of the bike messenger. Looking in from 
without, we see reckless   miscreants. Looking out from within, we see 
earnest athletes trying to   do a tough job in a hostile environment. It
 is, of course, not that   simple. </p>
<p> There is seeing from   within, and there is seeing from without. But
 there is also this: Two   reasonable people can stand on the same 
outside, look into the same   inside, and see totally different things. </p>

There is the guy in the green Suburban, an outsider who is obviously not a messenger fan.
<p></p>
<p> Then there are the   outsiders like the lawyer in a gray button-down
 shirt I found myself   standing next to at a urinal in a downtown 
office tower. </p>
<p> "Nice day," he said. "Better than all those gloomy winter days, huh?" </p>
<p> I agreed, said something about not looking forward to the rainy season. </p>
<p>"But you guys are   pretty bullet-proof, aren't you?" he said back, 
shooting me a look that I   took to be the highest form of admiration 
one man can safely express   for another in a bathroom. </p>
<p> Yes, I nodded, we are bullet-proof. <br clear="all">
  <br clear="all">
</p>
<p>And then there is Jack Dennerlein, an outsider who also happens to be
 a   professor of ergonomics and safety at the Harvard School of Public 
  Health. Dennerlein always admired messengers. "I have to admit that   
that's why I studied them," he says. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>34. Why did Dr. Dennerlein study bike messengers?</strong></p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Last year Dennerlein   and another Harvard researcher, John Meeker, 
released the results of   their study of occupational injuries among 113
 bike messengers in   Boston. No similar study has been done here, and 
the Washington   Department of Labor and Industries doesn't have good 
data on injuries   reported specifically by bike couriers. </p>
<p> But the size of   Boston and its messenger community is roughly 
comparable to Seattle. The   study there found high rates of injuries — 
greater than rates for the   meat-packing industry. And anecdotal 
evidence in Seattle suggests high   rates of injury here, too. </p>
<p> "Everyone's time comes," a local rider named Brent told me with typical fatalism. "I've got scars all over me from being hit." </p>

<p> Last summer I saw a   downtown biker dazed and bleeding after having
 gone through the back   window of a car. I heard horror stories of 
being pinned between Metro   buses, saw legs gouged by pedals, noticed 
the regular occurrence of   casts, bandages and limps. I heard about the
 messenger who, in June   2000, was killed by a motorist. </p>
<p> In this environment,   "wrecking" is almost a rite of passage. One 
of the times I felt most   embraced by the messengers was when I showed 
up for work on a Monday   sporting bruises and road rash from having 
crashed during a weekend   ride. Joe, a dashing messenger with so little
 body fat his veins look   like snakes slithering beneath his skin, came
 over to take a look at the   hard crust forming over my scrapes. "Yeah,
 scabbers!" he said, smiling   warmly. <br clear="all">

The Boston study painted a profile of the city's courier class:

<p> The average age of   those surveyed was 27, and most were men. They 
averaged 28 deliveries a   day. Ninety percent said they had been 
injured on the job at some point.   The most common cause of injury was 
collision with a motor vehicle; the   least common was collision with a 
pedestrian. </p>
<p> Given the numbers,   one surprising finding was that only 24 percent
 of the Boston messengers   wore helmets. In Seattle, only some 
messenger companies require   helmets, and many messengers ride without 
them. Yet most of the Boston   messengers surveyed, and many in Seattle,
 say their job is quite risky.   Another paradox. </p>

<p> The findings on   helmet use seem to support the idea that bike 
messengers tend to be   risk-takers — or, if you are feeling less 
charitable, idiots. Trouble   is, the study didn't assess who was at 
fault in the accidents or who   else was injured. So the data can be 
used to support either the view   that messengers are reckless or that 
they are victims of a hostile   environment. <br clear="all">

<p>DENNERLEIN WAS aware of the different ways messengers are seen, but 
he   tried to take an objective look. Perhaps their aggressive

<p> "The messengers have   created a survival mechanism to live on the 
streets," he says.   "Bicyclists are sort of locked between a rock and a
 hard place. They   can't be on the sidewalks — they're not pedestrians —
 but they're not   cars, either, and there's no room for them on the 
road." </p>
<p> And he saw their existence as an essential urban phenomenon. </p>
<p> "My view of them is   that they're part of our working community," 
he says. "They're providing   a service to the businesses of our

necessity." </p>

<p> Imagine what would   happen, Dennerlein says, if the thousands of 
deliveries bike messengers   make each day had to be carried  by car or 
foot. Traffic congestion   would increase, delivery times would slow, 
the pace of commerce would   slacken and the air would become more 
polluted. (In unpublished data,   Dennerlein and Meeker concluded that 
in the year 2000, the fact that   Boston's couriers delivered messages 
by bike instead of by light truck   saved 16.2 tons of carbon monoxide.)
 <br clear="all">
</p>
<p>In downtown Seattle, you have only to look at one aspect of the bike 
  messenger's job — legal deliveries — to see how indispensable 
messengers   are. About 5,500 lawyers do business there, and they rely 
heavily on   messengers to accomplish the essential errands that keep 
due process   from becoming overdue: filing court papers, serving 
subpoenas, pulling   case files, passing Mariners tickets to clients, 
ferrying that contested   silver flatware across town. </p>

<p> At the King County   Courthouse, the largest downtown judicial 
center, messengers are   constantly rushing through the metal detectors.
 This courthouse handles   about 300 filings a day, and while there is 
no way to tell how many of   those are done by messengers, hang out in 
the clerk's office just before   the noon and 4:30 p.m. filing deadlines
 and it becomes clear who's   doing the heavy lifting. The frantic <em>click, click, click </em>you
 hear   on the marble floors is not from high-powered lawyer heels. It 
is from   messengers' bike shoes dashing for the finish. The odor you 
smell is not   fancy cologne; it is unadulterated biker funk. </p>
<p> In this sense, the   entire apparatus of civil law and order in 
Seattle is supported by a   bunch of scofflaws who run red lights and go
 the wrong way down one-way   streets and scare the heck out of little 
old ladies — all to please the   court. Welcome to yet another paradox. <br clear="all">

<p>"They're paid to get somewhere quickly," says Dennerlein, "but that pay is an incentive to break the law." </p>
<p></p>
<p> This paradox seems to   have been with messengers since the 
beginning. The Greek god Hermes,   the archetypal messenger who wore 
winged shoes, was the son of Zeus and   presided over commerce. To the 
Greeks, messengers and their speed were   indispensable to trade. Yet 
even in that time, it seems messengers were   known not just for their 
physical prowess but also for their illicit   tendencies and their 
artistry. Besides being the god of commerce, Hermes   was the god of 
thieving and the inventor of the lyre. </p>

</p>
<p> What happened with   messengers after Hermes? The history page of 
the International   Federation of Bike Messenger Associations' Web site 
picks up the story   in 1894, when the Pullman rail strike shut down 
mail delivery to   virtually the entire United States. That year, the 
site says, a man in   California named Arthur C. Banta came up with a 
novel solution: He   arranged a relay of bicycle riders to deliver the 
mail between San   Francisco and Fresno. He even issued stamps with 
images of these   proto-bike messengers on them. </p>
<p> Later, with the   advent of the dense urban core, the idea of the 
bike messenger really   took off. The federation now counts bike 
messengers in 29 American   cities and 50 other cities worldwide. </p>

</p>
<p> IN SEATTLE, an entire   culture has grown up around the 
bike-messenger trade, a mix of   working-class toughness, athleticism, 
environmentalism, bike fetishism,   artistic openness, mechanical 
ingenuity, hard living and rebel rage.   Some messengers I knew 
moonlighted as members of the Infernal Noise   Brigade, the black-clad 
anarchist marching band you may remember from   the WTO protests; their 
water-cooler talk was of tear gas, tree-sitting   and Dumpster-diving. 
And every third rider seemed to have a slogan   affixed to some bit of 
gear. One popular helmet sticker: "YOU LOOK   STUPID DRIVING WITH A CELL
 PHONE." </p>
<p> Local messengers have   regular "Alley Cat" races around town. At 
the right abandoned parking   lot, on the right night, you'll find them 
playing their trademark game   of bike polo, in which bikes substitute 
for horses. Knock on the right   door at the right time, and you'll find
 a meeting of the Courier   Association of Seattle (note the acronym, 
CAOS), the muscle behind the   push to bring the messenger world 
championships to Seattle. </p>

</p>
<p> It's an addictive way   of life, full of us-against-the-world 
energy, and, because of this,   messengers often compare themselves to 
junkies. A few actually are   junkies, but most mean it this way: They 
can't quit the job or the   lifestyle, and if they do, they frequently 
go back. </p>
<p> "I can't deal with a   normal work environment," says A.J., a 
29-year-old messenger who has   been riding on and off for about eight 
years. "I refuse." </p>
<p> One reason A.J. stays   is that messenger society accepts anyone 
with the will to ride, and   collectively guards its members against the
 malevolence of outsiders.   For A.J., this is particularly important 
because she happens to be a   transsexual in transition from female to 
male. Unlike much of the rest   of the world, she's found the messenger 
trade to be a bastion of warmth   and open-mindedness. </p>
<p><strong>44. A.J. is ?</strong></p>

</p>
<p> "It's not even about   accepting," she says. "It's just sort of 
indifference. It's just like,   'Oh, OK you're still a messenger, 
right?' " </p>
<p> CHICAGO MESSENGER   Travis Hugh Culley recently wrote a book in 
which he lionized bike   couriers as an "immortal class" of superheroes 
who are "somehow exempt   from the so-called universal laws of life and 
death." </p>
<p> That's one view from the inside. When I told A.J. I was working on this article, she offered another. </p>
<p> "I'm scared, Eli,"   she said. "My nightmare would be you 
misrepresenting messengering as   this dream job that's full of 
excitement and superheroism. Sometimes   messengering is very humdrum. 
It's paper shuffling. It's not all   excitement and 'Woo-hoo!' and 'I'm a
 hero' and 'I'm free.' . . .   Sometimes it's very limiting. You don't 
always have the financial   resources that you'd like; sometimes you're 
too tired at the end of the   day to do what you want." </p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the end, that's   why I quit — too little money, too little energy
 left after work. Plus,   the winter was coming; if last summer taught 
me anything, it is that I'm   only a fair-weather messenger. </p>
<p> About Culley's praise   of the courier class, A.J. says: "I think 
it's crap. I fear death   absolutely every day. That's what makes me 
good . . . I will admit that,   maybe in my first year, I could have 
aligned with his ideology a little   more readily. But after I got hit 
by a Cadillac, my views changed." </p>
<p> The idealization of   messengers, A.J. says, is "common among people
 who have never   messengered and among rookies and among young men. </p>
<p> "I think you grow out of it." </p>

<h1>A Case Against Helmets in Lacrosse</h1>

  <p> Camille Richardson has heard all the arguments, read all the 
comments, and sees the logic. But as a freshman midfielder for the <a href="http://www.gocolumbialions.com/SportSelect.dbml?SPID=3879&amp;DB_OEM_ID=9600" title="The team’s Web site.">Columbia women’s lacrosse team</a>
 who is fully aware of the dangers of head trauma, Richardson makes one 
  thing clear: She has no interest in wearing a helmet, as the men must.
 </p>
  <p> “Wearing a helmet,” Richardson said, “would just bring us closer to football and hockey.” </p>
  <p> Although some safety advocates call for head protection in women’s
   lacrosse, almost everyone involved in the sport has said that its   
current ban on helmets for everyone but goaltenders is actually the   
safest approach. Hockey safety experts question if helmets foster more  
 physical play. Football looks back and wonders whether big face masks  
 encouraged a recklessness that can lead to long-term brain damage. </p>

<p> Now at its own crossroad, women’s lacrosse — with 250,000 playing   
nationwide — wants to take the road less battered. And so begins the   
second stage of sports’ continuing parry with head injuries — in which  
 the best protection, many experts insist, is no protection at all. </p>
  <p> “It’s hard to absolutely prove, but what we’ve seen is that 
behavior can   change when athletes feel more protected, especially when
 it comes to   the head and helmets,” said Dr. Margot Putukian, 
Princeton’s director of   athletic medicine services and chairwoman of 
the <a href="http://www.uslacrosse.org/" title="The Web site.">U.S. Lacrosse</a>
 safety committee. “They tend to put their bodies and heads in danger   
that they wouldn’t without the protection. And they aren’t as protected 
  as they might think.” </p>
  <p> Although boys’ lacrosse rules mandate helmets and face masks at 
all age   levels, girls’ lacrosse, whose season at many schools begins 
this month,   is drastically different. Amy Bokker, Stanford’s women’s 
coach, only   half-jokingly says that it shouldn’t be called lacrosse at
 all. </p>
  <p> Girls at all levels cannot body check; collisions are minimized. </p>
  <p> Contact with the head is so off limits that accidental intrusion 
with   stick or body within seven inches of the head — an area known as 
the   halo — is a major foul. Even shooting with a defender in line with
 the   goal is illegal. </p>

  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;  </p>
  <p> Even so, girls’ lacrosse does see its share of concussions, mostly
 on   accidental stick-to-head contact, collisions and falls. According 
to   research by Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, not 
only   does the sport have the third-highest rate of concussion among 
female   scholastic sports (behind soccer and basketball), but its 
in-game rate   is only about 15 percent less than the rougher male 
version. </p>
  <p> Research suggests that even though men’s lacrosse helmets are 
required   only to eliminate skull fracture and intracranial bleeding — 
like   football helmets — the headgear is probably decreasing the 
concussion   rate to some extent. Yet as recently as December, the New 
York State   Public High School Athletic Association voted by 9 to 2 to 
continue   banning hard helmets in the women’s game, a stance echoed by 
U.S.   Lacrosse. </p>
  <p> Not everyone agrees with that decision. </p>
  <p> “Any time we can prevent a concussion, we should try to do it,” said Dr. Brian Rieger, director of the <a href="http://www.upstate.edu/uh/pmr/concussion/sports/" title="The Web site.">Central New York Sports Concussion Center</a>,
   who has shared his feelings with U.S. Lacrosse. “Even though it’s   
usually a short-lived event, there are certain situations, I’ve seen it,
   where even a kid with one concussion can be out of school for weeks 
or   months, and struggle. When you see a child or parent go through it,
 it   makes me feel we should do anything to prevent it.” </p>

</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> At the annual meeting last month of the National Organizing 
Committee on   Standards for Athletic Equipment, or Nocsae, which sets 
performance   standards for almost all organized sports’ safety gear, 
one of the most   heated exchanges concerned U.S. Lacrosse’s continued 
ban on hard helmets   and face guards. Dr. Jack Ryan, representing the <a href="http://www.sportsmed.org/tabs/Index.aspx" title="The Web site.">American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine</a>,
   complained: “Somebody’s got to stand up and say, What are you doing? 
  This to me is like, come on, you’re not serious. This is 2011.” </p>
  <p> Then again, other sports have spent the last several years 
realizing   that safety equipment can bring dangers of its own. Checking
 in   professional hockey became considerably more vicious with the 
adoption   of helmets in the 1970s and ’80s, and football players felt 
so protected   by their helmets and face masks that head-to-head 
collisions became   commonplace at every age level. Scaling back 
protection now in order to   dissuade violent play would be too 
dangerous, experts say, both   physically and legally. </p>
  <p> Even though women’s lacrosse rules against contact would be 
unchanged or   even strengthened with the adoption of helmets, the ethos
 would almost   certainly change, more than a dozen coaches, players and
 officials said   in interviews. One of Camille Richardson’s teammates 
at Columbia, the   senior attacker Olivia Mann, said that after the move
 to make eyewear   mandatory for the 2005 season, “It’s subconscious, 
but you see harder   checking, and rougher play.” </p>
  <p><strong>54. Eyewear became mandatory in what season? </strong></p>

  </p>
  <p> Richardson and Mann gladly demonstrated what they see helmets 
doing to   their sport. As Mann played defense and Richardson cradled 
the ball with   her head up, the women used their feet to grab position 
and cut. </p>
  <p> The term, they explained, was to “wrong-foot” your opponent. </p>
  <p> They were then asked to pretend they were wearing helmets. Without
   knowing it, solely on instinct, Mann violated the halo rule by 
swinging   her stick close to Richardson’s head. This was partly because
   Richardson, feeling protected, slightly dipped her head and leaned in
   toward, rather than away, from contact. </p>
  <p><strong>55. What rule was violated when a stick is swung close to the opponent's head? </strong></p>
  <p>
    <input name="Submit44" onclick="MM_popupMsg('Yay, correct!')" value="Halo" type="submit">

    <input name="Submit44" onclick="MM_popupMsg('Sorry, Try again.')" value="Stickspace" type="submit">
  </p>
  <p> “I would be more likely to take risky checks, which would change 
the   nature of defense completely,” Mann said. “Now, trying not to foul
 her,   it’s very much about where I get my hands and body. If she’s 
wearing a   helmet, I don’t have to worry about physically injuring her.
 I’m more   likely to sacrifice my body positioning to get at her 
stick.” </p>
  <p> Another teammate, Kelly Buechel, said, “You want someone to beat 
you   because they’re more skilled than you, not because they’re more 
brutal   than you.” </p>
  <p> Mouth guards and eye guards are required in women’s lacrosse. And 
the   rules have for decades allowed soft headgear — usually a headband 
or a   crown of soft padding, borrowed from kickboxing or elsewhere. But
 these   go essentially unused because players consider them either 
unnecessary   or ugly. (Web sites for three women’s lacrosse equipment 
outlets don’t   list any sort of head protection for sale.) The rare 
women’s player who   does wear the soft headgear, experts said, usually 
has a prior head   injury and is feeling more protected than she 
actually is. </p>
  <p> In November, U.S. Lacrosse did accede and approach Nocsae about   
developing a standard for some form of head protection for women —   
almost certainly soft — that might protect against some stick-to-head   
concussions. Nocsae officials at the annual meeting recommended at least
   hard face masks, if not helmets, and somewhat grudgingly accepted the
   assignment. </p>
  <p> The U.S. Lacrosse president, Steve Stenersen, said that during 
this age   of concussion awareness in youth sports, he opposed any 
headgear that   would, he said, “upset the balance between safety and 
game integrity, or   bring some unintended consequence.” </p>
  <p> “Everybody looks at equipment intervention as the end-all, be-all —
 but   it’s not, and the football discussion bears that out,” Stenersen 
said.   He added that U.S. Lacrosse would rather emphasize education and
 rules   enforcement and keep the game unchanged. </p>
  <p> “People are less focused on those because they’re less tangible, 
and the   picture of a helmet on a kid makes them feel better,” he said.
 “But   it’s much more complicated than that.” </p>

<h1>Stocks Post Gains in Break From Gloom on Wall Street</h1>

  <p data-num="0" data-key="SphSph">Stocks pushed higher on Tuesday led 
by financial shares as the market   showed signs of recovery from the 
worst sell-off on Wall Street in more   than two years. </p>
  <p data-num="1" data-key="IahIah">Investors are hoping that the recent
 turmoil in global stock markets   will abate, but they still expect the
 markets to remain unsettled a day   after Wall Street’s worst showing 
since December 2008. </p>
  <p data-num="2" data-key="TmsTms">The markets spiraled downward on 
Monday, the first trading day after the   decision late Friday by 
Standard &amp; Poor’s to downgrade its rating   of the United States 
government’s long-term credit. </p>
  <p data-num="3" data-key="IalIal">Investors are looking ahead to a 
meeting later Tuesday of the United   States Federal Reserve’s policy 
board, seeking any guidance or signals   about the economy or the 
possibility of the Fed injecting any further   monetary stimulus to help
 stem the crisis in confidence. </p>
  <p data-num="4" data-key="ItaIij">“I think all eyes are on the Fed,” 
Douglas Cote, the chief market   strategist for ING Investment 
Management, said. But he added that a new   program of stimulus was 
unlikely to be introduced at this time, when the   economy needed 
policies to cut spending and promote growth. “It is just   going to 
delay the true fixes that need to take place,” he said. </p>

 Peter V. Coleman, head of equity research at JMP Securities, said that 
  although investors seemed focused on the downgrade, its effect was   
mostly psychological. Otherwise there was little relevance to the   
financial markets, he said, pointing to the fact that United States   
government bonds were still in demand on Monday even after the rating   
was lowered. </p>

points and 2.70 percent. The Nasdaq rose 78.40 points and 3.33 percent. 
  The three indexes had surged at the opening, dipped back and then rose
   again. Financial stocks, which had taken a battering on Monday, were 
up   more than 4 percent. </p>

    <p>Exercise can help ease joint pain and stiffness for arthritis 
sufferers. But despite urgings from health officials and plenty of 
science documenting its benefits, many men and women with osteoarthritis
 do not engage in any meaningful physical activity in a typical week, 
according to new research.</p>
    <p>The findings directly contradict what many arthritis patients 
themselves report when asked about their exercise habits. Studies in the
 past have generally shown that 30 to 40 percent of people with 
arthritis say they get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity 
exercise each week, or about 20 minutes a day, the minimum amount that 
the federal government recommends for all adults.</p>
    <p>But when researchers at the Northwestern University Feinberg 
School of Medicine used special devices to track the activity levels of 
more than 1,000 people with knee osteoarthritis, they were surprised to 
find that many were in fact couch potatoes. Only 13 percent of men and 8
 percent of women met the federal guidelines for activity.</p>

    <p>Exercise is specifically recommended for osteoarthritis patients 
because it can reduce pain, ease joint stiffness, increase strength and 
improve mobility, said Dorothy Dunlop, an associate professor of 
medicine at Northwestern and an author of the study.</p>
    <p>“Physical activity is a positive intervention for people with joint disease,” she said.<span id="more-57651"></span>
 “We certainly applaud the 10 percent of people who met the target, but 
we also recognize that many adults with arthritis are not meeting the 
target, and for that group the advice is to be as physically active as 
possible, even if they accomplish less than the recommended level.”</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21792835">As part of the study</a>,
 published in the current issue of the journal Arthritis &amp; 
Rheumatism, Dr. Dunlop and her colleagues asked more than 1,000 people 
with osteoarthritis to wear accelerometers, small pedometerlike devices 
that measured their levels of movement and activity. The participants 
ranged in age from 49 to 84 and wore the devices for a week.</p>
    <p>The finding that was most alarming, Dr. Dunlop said, was that 
almost half the people in the study met the Department of Health and 
Human Services definition for “inactive,” meaning they did not 
participate in any moderate exercise lasting at least 10 minutes at any 
point over the course of the week.</p>
    <p>“Frequently they’re very surprised,” she said. “They thought that
 they were doing vigorous activity and working hard, but the monitor 
measures no vigorous activity.”</p>
    <p>Some arthritis sufferers steer clear of physical activity because
 of pain and stiffness. Others find their energy sapped by conditions 
like diabetes or heart disease, Dr. Dunlop said. </p>

    <p>But there is also a widespread perception that people with 
arthritis need to rest their joints, a myth that the Centers for Disease
 Control and Prevention <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/pa_overview.htm">has worked hard to dispel.</a>
 The American College of Rheumatology has also made a point of 
encouraging people with arthritis to spend more time going on brisk 
walks or taking part in water aerobics and other activities that can 
benefit their joints.</p>
    <p>Still, Dr. Dunlop said she believes doctors who treat patients 
with arthritis are the ones who can have the greatest effect. “There is 
evidence that if a person is encouraged by their physician to be active,
 it’s a stronger message than if they’re encouraged by a friend or a 
family member,” she said. “So it would be wonderful if one of the first 
messengers was their own physician.”</p>

    <p> DuPont, which held discussions with the E.P.A. on the herbicide,
 suspended sales of the product last week and announced plans for a 
refund program. The company already faces lawsuits from property owners 
who lost numerous trees after landscapers began applying Imprelis to 
lawns and golf courses this spring. </p>
    <p> A spokesman for the E.P.A., Larry Jackson, said the agency acted
 because data provided by DuPont showed that at least three types of 
evergreens — balsam fir, Norway spruce and white pine trees — were 
susceptible to damage or death from Imprelis. </p>

    <p> In a statement, the agency said it was investigating whether the
 widespread tree deaths resulted from misuse of the weed killer, 
inadequate warnings or directions on the product’s label, its 
persistence in soil and plant material or other factors. </p>
    <p> Kate Childress, a spokeswoman for DuPont, said that the data 
mentioned by the E.P.A. indicated vulnerability only when the three tree
 species were exposed to “extreme conditions” in tests. </p>
    <p> “We did them to understand the tolerance and sensitivity of 
these species under extreme conditions,” she said. Those tests were 
conducted before the product was approved by the E.P.A. last fall, she 
added. </p>
    <p> Whether the product will return to the market after the agency’s review is unclear. </p>

    <p> Only turf and landscaping professionals were allowed to buy or 
apply Imprelis. While it has been highly effective at killing clover and
 broad-leafed weeds like dandelions, landscapers say, nearby evergreens 
in many cases began dying within weeks of the first applications. Some 
agricultural experts have suggested that the tree toll could reach into 
the hundreds of thousands. </p>
    <p> Landscapers had initially welcomed the herbicide, which was 
marketed as an environmentally friendly product that did not, for 
example, pose risks to animals. However, state environmental officials 
in New York did not approve its use because in tests the herbicide did 
not bind with soil and seeped into the groundwater. </p>
    <p> The national law firm Parker, Waichman and Alonso has filed a 
dozen lawsuits against DuPont over the tree deaths in federal courts 
across the Midwest, and more are pending. </p>
    <p> “We expect at the end of the day there’s going to be more than a
 billion dollars of damage or as much as several billion,” said Jordan 
Chaikin, a partner in the firm. “You are talking about a lot of people 
who have dead trees 40 to 50 feet tall, 30 or 50 years old that each 
cost $20,000 or $25,000 to replace.” </p>
    <p> Imprelis has also caused concern among composters. DuPont warns 
in its instructions that grass clippings treated with Imprelis should 
not be composted because the chemical does not break down. </p>
    <p> “You have to ask why the E.P.A. would allow a chemical out there
 that doesn’t break down,” said Dan Sullivan, the managing editor of 
BioCycle Magazine. “It could be a problem for months or years to come.” </p>

      <p> What does extreme heat do to medications? I found out while we were <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/sweating/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="In-depth reference and news articles about Sweating." class="meta-classifier">sweating</a> out the recent heat wave in a lake cabin in New Hampshire and my 10-year-old son’s <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/allergies/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="In-depth reference and news articles about Allergies." class="meta-classifier">allergies</a> kicked up. </p>
      <p> I gave him a dose of over-the-counter medicine that usually brings quick relief. But this time the drug had no effect. The same thing happened the next day, and the next. </p>
      <p> When I returned home, I asked a pharmacist about it. Was my son becoming immune to this particular medicine? Were his allergies getting worse? </p>
      <p> The pharmacist asked where I had stored his pills as the temperatures soared. On the bathroom shelf in the cabin, I said. And on the sweltering six-hour drive to the lake? The medicine was in my suitcase in the trunk of the car. </p>
      <p> And that’s when I learned this: No drug should be exposed to temperatures higher than 86 degrees. Some days the bathroom at our vacation house and certainly the trunk of the car were well above that mark. </p>
      <p> Extreme temperatures can have a big effect on both prescription and over-the-counter drugs. </p>
      <p> Pharmaceutical manufacturers recommend most of their products be stored at a controlled room temperature of 68 to 77 degrees, said Skye McKennon, clinical assistant professor at the University of Washington School of Pharmacy. In truth, that is the range in which manufacturers guarantee product integrity. Anywhere from 58 to 86 degrees is still fine, she said. </p>
      <p> “During heat waves and cold spells, storage locations can go above or below those ranges, causing medicines to physically change, lose potency or even threaten your health,” Dr. McKennon said. </p>
      <p> For patients with such chronic illnesses as <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/diabetes/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="In-depth reference and news articles about Diabetes." class="meta-classifier">diabetes</a> or heart disease, a damaged dose of a crucial medicine, like insulin or nitroglycerin, can be life-threatening. But even common medicines can break down with potentially harmful effects, and you can’t always tell by looking at the pill or liquid that a problem has occurred, said Janet Engle, a pharmacist and past president of the American Pharmacists Association. </p>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>

      <p> <strong>A COOL, DRY PLACE</strong> Despite the name, the medicine cabinet is often the worst place to store drugs because of the frequent high humidity in the bathroom. (Moisture is a particular menace for quick-dissolve tablets, the type my son was taking.) </p>
      <p> Instead, save that space for bandages and toothpaste. Keep medicines in a cool, dry place, like a hallway linen closet, bedroom closet or even a kitchen cabinet away from the stove. If children or animals can get into these spaces, consider a higher shelf or lockbox. </p>
      <p> <strong>SPECIAL PACKAGING</strong> Don’t be lulled by expensive special packages designed to “protect” drugs, like a bubble or foil pack. There is no evidence that these packages protect medicine any better than a standard pill bottle, Dr. McKennon said. </p>
      <p> That said, never take medicine out of the original packaging where it may be more exposed to the elements. One exception: Elderly or seriously ill patients often need day-by-day pill boxes to help keep their dosages accurate. These should be stored in a cool, dry place. </p>
      <p> A special note about insulin: It can easily degrade if it is frozen or too hot, said Dr. Vivian Fonseca, a physician and president-elect of the American Diabetes Association. Unopened bottles of insulin are best kept in the refrigerator. Open bottles, however, can be kept at room temperature, which also makes injections more comfortable. </p>

            <p> EINDHOVEN, the Netherlands — As Sander Van Dedem recalled watching the charges tick up every 10 seconds on the dashboard meter on the way to the airport, he resolved to try public transportation next time.  “Looking at the money makes you realize that a car isn’t always a good idea,” said Mr. Van Dedem, a commercial sales manager for I.B.M. here. </p>
            <p> But his pricey ride was not in a taxi. He was driving his own <a title="Times review" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/automobiles/autoreviews/24volvo.html">Volvo XC60</a>. </p>
            <p> The car had been outfitted with the meter so that Mr. Van Dedem could take part in a <a title="About the trial" href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/29507.wss">trial</a> of a controversial government tax proposal to charge drivers a fee for the miles they drive. The meter also factors in the cost to society in the form of pollution, traffic congestion, greenhouse gas emissions and wear and tear on roads. </p>
            <p>  Hooked up to the Internet wirelessly and to GPS, the system tabulates a charge for each car trip by using a mileage-based formula that also takes account of a car’s <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/fuel_efficiency/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="Recent and archival news about fuel efficiency." class="meta-classifier">fuel efficiency</a>, the time of day and the route. (Driving on busier thoroughfares costs more than driving on less-traveled roads.) At the end of each month, the vehicle’s owner would receive a bill detailing times and costs of usage, not unlike a cellphone bill, although participants in the trial did not have to pay the charges. </p>
            <p> Governments in car-clogged regions of Europe, Asia and even the United States have shown an eagerness to explore such systems, but they face a nagging challenge in placing them in private vehicles. Even in environmentally conscious places like the Netherlands, voters and politicians often vehemently oppose the programs, citing privacy concerns about the monitoring of drivers’ whereabouts and the introduction of what amounts to a new type of tax. </p>
            <p> In the Netherlands, where by some accounts residents have the highest average commuting time in Europe and a reputation for receptivity to environmental innovation, the government had planned to institute a <a title="About the plan and its troubles (PDF file)" href="http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/1192818.PDF">nationwide system</a> next year.  But the plan was shelved when a new government came to power in 2010. </p>
            <p> “The winning party said, ‘If you elect us, there won’t be new taxes,’ and killed the plan,” said Ab Oosting, a city official in Eindhoven.  </p>

            <p> Supporters of the meters contend that the charges are more equitable than current taxes like automobile purchase and registration fees, because they derive from actual use rather than mere ownership. If imposed, they could supplant gas and vehicle taxes as well as tolls. Governments could program  computers to require consistent gas guzzlers to pay higher rates, for example.  </p>
            <p> Distance charging also provides a means of replacing declining revenues from gasoline taxes as more people drive highly efficient, hybrid or <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/electric_vehicles/index.html?&amp;inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about electric vehicles." class="meta-classifier">electric cars</a>, helping governments that have traditionally depended on gas taxes for road upkeep.  </p>
            <p> Equally important, studies have found that the meters provide instantaneous negative feedback, the kind that psychologists say changes behavior. </p>
            <p> “At the beginning you’re looking at it all the time and thinking of costs, and pretty quickly it starts to influence what you do,” said Mr. Van Dedem, whose rush-hour airport ride would have incurred a charge of just over $5 under the rates proposed in the Netherlands. </p>
            <p> The effect has been lasting: even though the trial was two years ago and the meter has been removed, he now works from home more in the mornings and walks to the market, he said. </p>
            <p> In Europe, countries like Germany and Denmark “were looking to the Netherlands to test the technology” and were disappointed when the plan was shelved, said Peder Jensen, a transportation expert at the <a title="The agency’s Web site" href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/">European Environment Agency</a>. Germany has already started using a GPS-based charging system for trucks, and France is planning to do so, a step that is less politically volatile than charging drivers of private cars. </p>
            <p> <a title="About the plans" href="http://moneywatch.bnet.com/spending/blog/cars-money/new-tax-would-penalize-electric-cars-for-not-using-gas/2612/">In the United States</a>, states including Oregon, Texas and Minnesota have explored mileage charging systems, but the first tentative proposals have faced obstacles there as well. <a title="About the proposal" href="http://gov.oregonlive.com/bill/2011/HB2328/">A longstanding proposal in Oregon</a> to introduce such charging for electric cars stalled in committee this spring and never made it to a vote. It suggested a transitional rate of 0.85 cents per mile in 2015 and 1.56 cents per mile by 2018.  </p>
            <p> Although the program was primarily an attempt to recoup lost revenue from gasoline taxes, it was also intended to test the waters for distance charging that would eventually apply to all cars. </p>
            <p> “We started with a new type of car where the policy argument was clear: electric vehicles don’t pay gas taxes,” said James M. Whitty, manager of Oregon’s <a title="The office’s Web site" href="http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/HWY/OIPP/index.shtml">Office of Innovative Partnerships and Alternative Funding</a>. “But the idea was to get by the anxiety about what the new tax system was about, to see if it would be acceptable.” </p>
            <p> The Oregon proposal did not envisage installing real-time GPS-based meters in each car, but merely recording the mileage though the odometer. An earlier trial using a GPS unit had stirred a public outcry even though the unit did not reveal locations as it relayed data to the state.  “The public didn’t trust that,” Mr. Whitty said. </p>

            <p> “The trials work well, but it’s first a psychological issue and second a political choice,” he said. “To do it you need support of the government, and it needs to happen when there is not an election because there’s always a bit of resistance.” </p>
            <p> Under the shelved plan in the Netherlands, rates would have varied from 4.5 to 45 cents per mile. Government studies predicted that 60 or 70 percent of drivers would pay less than under the current system of car taxation. </p>
            <p> The European Union <a title="About Europe’s plans" href="http://ec.europa.eu/transport/strategies/2011_white_paper_en.htm">continues to prod</a> member states to try distance charging despite the setbacks. High car and gas taxes have failed to stem the growth of car use in Western Europe, leaving densely populated countries paralyzed at rush hour. </p>
            <p> Belgium plans to start a small trial of 50 drivers in September. “Traffic jams are expected to double by 2020; the roads are full, full, full,” said Freidl Maertens, director of the pilot program in Leuven, Belgium. Singapore is also contemplating a mileage-based tax system, though so far the plans do not include a digital display, which some experts see as a crucial component. According to data collected in the Eindhoven trial, watching the small charges add up changed driving habits. </p>
            <p> “Seeing the meter helps,” Mr. Huitema said. “The old taxes don’t do that — you fill the tank, pay and try not to worry anymore.” </p>

      <p> For the last decade <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="In-depth reference and news articles about Cancer." class="meta-classifier">cancer</a> research has been guided by a common vision of how a single cell, outcompeting its neighbors, evolves into a malignant tumor. </p>
      <p> Through a series of random mutations, genes that encourage cellular division are pushed into overdrive, while genes that normally send growth-restraining signals are taken offline. </p>
      <p> With the accelerator floored and the brake lines cut, the cell and its progeny are free to rapidly multiply. More mutations accumulate, allowing the cancer cells to elude other safeguards and to invade neighboring tissue and metastasize. </p>
      <p> These basic principles — laid out 11 years ago in a landmark paper, “<a title="Article text." href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867400816839">The Hallmarks of Cancer</a>,” by Douglas Hanahan and Robert A. Weinberg, and revisited in a follow-up article this year — still serve as the reigning paradigm, a kind of Big Bang theory for the field. </p>
      <p> But recent discoveries have been complicating the picture with tangles of new detail. Cancer appears to be even more willful and calculating than previously imagined. </p>
      <p> Most DNA, for example, was long considered junk — a netherworld of detritus that had no important role in cancer or anything else. Only about 2 percent of the human genome carries the code for making enzymes and other proteins, the cogs and scaffolding of the machinery that a cancer cell turns to its own devices. </p>
      <p> These days “junk” DNA is referred to more respectfully as “noncoding” DNA, and researchers are finding clues that “pseudogenes” lurking within this dark region may play a role in cancer. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;      </p>
      <p> “We’ve been obsessively focusing our attention on 2 percent of the genome,” said Dr. Pier Paolo Pandolfi, a professor of medicine and pathology at Harvard Medical School. This spring, at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Orlando, Fla., he described a new “biological dimension” in which signals coming from both regions of the genome participate in the delicate balance between normal cellular behavior and malignancy. </p>
      <p> As they look beyond the genome, cancer researchers are also awakening to the fact that some 90 percent of the protein-encoding cells in our body are microbes. We evolved with them in a symbiotic relationship, which raises the question of just who is occupying whom. </p>
      <p> “We are massively outnumbered,” said Jeremy K. Nicholson, <strong> </strong>chairman of biological chemistry and head of the department of surgery and cancer at Imperial College London. Altogether, he said, 99 percent of the functional genes in the body are microbial. </p>
      <p> In Orlando, he and other researchers described how genes in this microbiome — exchanging messages with genes inside human cells — may be involved with cancers of the colon, stomach, esophagus and other organs. </p>
      <p> These shifts in perspective, occurring throughout cellular biology, can seem as dizzying as what happened in cosmology with the discovery that <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/dark_matter/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="" class="meta-classifier">dark matter</a> and <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/dark_energy_astronomy/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="" class="meta-classifier">dark energy</a> make up most of the universe: Background suddenly becomes foreground and issues once thought settled are up in the air. In cosmology the Big Bang theory emerged from the confusion in a stronger but more convoluted form. The same may be happening with the science of cancer. </p>

      <p> <strong>Exotic Players</strong> </p>
      <p> According to the central dogma of molecular biology, information encoded in the DNA of the genome is copied by messenger RNA and then carried to subcellular structures called ribosomes, where the instructions are used to assemble proteins. Lurking behind the scenes, snippets called microRNAs once seemed like little more than molecular noise. But they have been appearing with increasing prominence in theories about cancer. </p>
      <p> By binding to a gene’s messenger RNA, microRNA can prevent the instructions from reaching their target — essentially silencing the gene — and may also modulate the signal in other ways. One presentation after another at the Orlando meeting explored how microRNAs are involved in the fine-tuning that distinguishes a healthy cell from a malignant one. </p>
      <p> Ratcheting the complexity a notch higher, Dr. Pandolfi, the Harvard Medical School researcher, laid out an elaborate theory involving microRNAs and pseudogenes. For every pseudogene there is a regular, protein-encoding gene. (Both are believed to be derived from a common ancestral gene, the pseudogene shunted aside in the evolutionary past when it became dysfunctional.) While normal genes express their will by sending signals of messenger RNA, the damaged pseudogenes either are mute or speak in gibberish. </p>
      <p> Or so it was generally believed. Little is wasted by evolution, and Dr. Pandolfi hypothesizes that RNA signals from both genes and pseudogenes interact through a language involving microRNAs. (These signals are called ceRNAs, pronounced “sernas,” meaning “competing endogenous RNAs.”) </p>
      <p> His lab at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston is studying how this arcane back channel is used by genes called PTEN and KRAS, commonly implicated in cancer, to confer with their pseudotwins. The hypothesis is laid out in more detail this month<strong> <em> </em></strong> <a title="Essay abstract." href="http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2811%2900812-9">in an essay in the journal Cell</a>. </p>

      <p> Fueled by the free espresso offered by pharmaceutical companies hawking their wares, scientists at the Orlando meeting moved from session to session and browsed corridors of posters, looking for what might have recently been discovered about other exotic players: lincRNA, (for large intervening noncoding), siRNA (small interfering), snoRNA (small nucleolar) and piRNA (Piwi-interacting (short for “P-element induced wimpy testis” (a peculiar term that threatens to pull this sentence into a regress of nested parenthetical explanations))). </p>
      <p> In their original “hallmarks” paper — the most cited in the history of Cell — Dr. Hanahan and Dr. Weinberg gathered a bonanza of emerging research and synthesized it into six characteristics. All of them, they proposed, are shared by most and maybe all human cancers. They went on to predict that in 20 years the circuitry of a cancer cell would be mapped and understood as thoroughly as the transistors on a computer chip, making cancer biology more like chemistry or physics — sciences governed by precise, predictable rules. </p>
      <p> Now there appear to be transistors inside the transistors. “I still think that the wiring diagram, or at least its outlines, may be laid out within a decade,” Dr. Weinberg said in an e-mail. “MicroRNAs may be more like minitransistors or amplifiers, but however one depicts them, they still must be soldered into the circuit in one way or another.” </p>
      <p> In their follow-up paper, “<a title="Article abstract." href="http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2811%2900127-9">Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation</a>,” he and Dr. Hanahan cited two “emerging hallmarks” that future research may show to be crucial to malignancy — the ability of an aberrant cell to reprogram its metabolism to feed its wildfire growth and to evade destruction by the immune system. </p>

      <p> <strong>Unwitting Allies</strong> </p>
      <p> Even if all the lines and boxes for the schematic of the cancer cell can be sketched in, huge complications will remain. Research is increasingly focused on the fact that a <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/tumor/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="In-depth reference and news articles about Tumors." class="meta-classifier">tumor</a> is not a homogeneous mass of cancer cells. It also contains healthy cells that have been conscripted into the cause. </p>
      <p> Cells called fibroblasts collaborate by secreting proteins the tumor needs to build its supportive scaffolding and expand into surrounding tissues. Immune system cells, maneuvered into behaving as if they were healing a wound, emit growth factors that embolden the tumor and stimulate angiogenesis, the generation of new blood vessels. Endothelial cells, which form the lining of the circulatory system, are also enlisted in the construction of the tumor’s own blood supply. </p>
      <p> All these processes are so tightly intertwined that it is difficult to tell where one leaves off and another begins. With so much internal machinery, malignant <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/tumor/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="In-depth reference and news articles about Tumor." class="meta-classifier">tumors</a> are now being compared to renegade organs sprouting inside the body. </p>
      <p> As the various cells are colluding, they may also be trading information with cells in another realm — the micro-organisms in the mouth, skin, respiratory system, urogenital tract, stomach and digestive system. Each microbe has its own set of genes, which can interact with those in the human body by exchanging molecular signals. </p>
      <p> “The signaling these microbes do is dramatically complex,” Dr. Nicholson said in an interview at Imperial College. “They send metabolic signals to each other — and they are sending chemicals out constantly that are stimulating our biological processes. </p>
      <p> “It’s astonishing, really. There they are, sitting around and doing stuff, and most of it we don’t really know or understand.” </p>

      <p> People in different geographical locales can harbor different microbial ecosystems. Last year scientists reported evidence that the Japanese microbiome has acquired a gene for a seaweed-digesting enzyme from a marine bacterium. The gene, not found in the guts of North Americans, may aid in the digestion of sushi wrappers. The idea that people in different regions of the world have co-evolved with different microbial ecosystems may be a factor — along with diet, lifestyle and other environmental agents — in explaining why they are often subject to different cancers. </p>
      <p> The composition of the microbiome changes not only geographically but also over time. With improved hygiene, dietary changes and the rising use of <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/antibiotics/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="Recent and archival health news about antibiotics." class="meta-classifier">antibiotics</a>, levels of the microbe <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/helicobacter-pylori/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="In-depth reference and news articles about Helicobacter pylori ." class="meta-classifier">Helicobacter pylori</a> in the human gut have been decreasing in developing countries, and so has <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/gastric-cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="In-depth reference and news articles about Gastric cancer." class="meta-classifier">stomach cancer</a>. At the same time, however, <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/esophageal-cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="In-depth reference and news articles about Esophageal cancer." class="meta-classifier">esophageal cancer</a> has been increasing, leading to speculation that H. pylori provides some kind of protective effect. </p>
      <p> At the Orlando meeting, Dr. Zhiheng Pei of New York University suggested that the situation is more complex. Two different types of microbial ecosystems have been identified in the human esophagus. Dr. Pei’s lab has found that people with an inflamed esophagus or with a precancerous condition called Barrett’s esophagus are more likely to harbor what he called the Type II microbiome. </p>
      <p> “At present, it is unclear whether the Type II microbiome causes esophageal diseases or gastro-esophageal reflux changes the microbiome from Type I to II,” Dr. Pei wrote in an e-mail. “Either way, chronic exposure of the esophagus to an abnormal microbiome could be an essential step in esophageal damage and, ultimately, cancer.” </p>
