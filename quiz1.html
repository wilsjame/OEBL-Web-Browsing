<h1>A Lustrous Pinnacle of Hollywood Glamour</h1>
<h6>By MEL GUSSOW</h6>
<div id="articleBody">
  <p> <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/1547611/Elizabeth-Taylor?inline=nyt-per" title="">Elizabeth Taylor</a>,
   the actress who dazzled generations of moviegoers with her stunning  
 beauty and whose name was synonymous with Hollywood glamour, died on   
Wednesday in Los Angeles. She was 79. </p>
  <p> A spokeswoman at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center said Ms. Taylor died 
at   1:28 a.m. Pacific time. Her publicist, Sally Morrison, said the 
cause   was complications of congestive heart failure. Ms. Taylor had 
had a   series of medical setbacks over the years and was hospitalized 
six weeks   ago with heart problems. </p>
  <p><strong>8. How old was  Ms. Taylor when she died?</strong></p>

  </p>
  <p> In a world of flickering images, Elizabeth Taylor was a constant 
star.   First appearing on screen at age 10, she grew up there, never 
passing   through an awkward age. It was one quick leap from <a title="Trailer for the film." href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NYsONLJUTQ">“National Velvet”</a> to <a title="Trailer for the film." href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Fm6sa_L5_4">“A Place in the Sun”</a> and from there to<a title="Trailer for the film." href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGDyZHlHklo"> “Cleopatra,”</a> as she was indelibly transformed from a vulnerable child actress into a voluptuous film queen. </p>
  <p> In a career of some 70 years and more than 50 films, she won two 
Academy   Awards as best actress, for her performances as a call girl in
   “BUtterfield 8” (1960) and as the<a title="A scene from the film" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nInE5TITzE8"> acid-tongued Martha</a> in “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” (1966). <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/104435/Mike-Nichols?inline=nyt-per" title="">Mike Nichols</a>, who directed her in “Virginia Woolf,” said he considered her “one of the greatest cinema actresses.” </p>

  <p> When Ms. Taylor was honored in 1986 by the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/f/film_society_of_lincoln_center/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Film Society of Lincoln Center">Film Society of Lincoln Center</a>,
   Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times, “More than anyone else I 
can   think of, Elizabeth Taylor represents the complete movie 
phenomenon —   what movies are as an art and an industry, and what they 
have meant to   those of us who have grown up watching them in the 
dark.</p>

  <p> Ms. Taylor’s popularity endured throughout her life, but critics 
were   sometimes reserved in their praise of her acting. In that sense 
she may   have been upstaged by her own striking beauty. Could anyone as
 lovely as   Elizabeth Taylor also be talented? The answer, of course, 
was yes. </p>
  <p> Given her lack of professional training, the range of her acting 
was   surprisingly wide. She played predatory vixens and wounded 
victims. She   was Cleopatra of the burnished barge; <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/1286086/Tennessee-Williams?inline=nyt-per" title="">Tennessee Williams</a>’s Maggie the cat; Catherine Holly, who confronted terror suddenly last summer; and <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/314726/William-Shakespeare?inline=nyt-per" title="">Shakespeare</a>’s Kate. Her melodramatic heroines would have been at home on soap operas. </p>

  <p>Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who directed her in “<a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/gst/movies/titlelist.html?v_idlist=132887;47563&amp;inline=nyt_ttl">Suddenly, Last Summer</a>” and “<a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/gst/movies/titlelist.html?v_idlist=288314;87424;9963;295856;87423;451178;9962&amp;inline=nyt_ttl">Cleopatra</a>,”
   saw her for the first time, in Cannes, when she was 18. “She was the 
  most incredible vision of loveliness I have ever seen in my life,” he 
  said. “And she was sheer innocence.”</p>
  <p> Mankiewicz admired her professionalism. “Whatever the script 
called for,   she played it,” he said. “The thread that goes through the
 whole is   that of a woman who is an honest performer. Therein lies her
 identity.” </p>
  <p> It was also Mankiewicz who said that for Ms. Taylor, “living life 
was a   kind of acting,” that she lived her life “in screen time.” </p>

  <p> <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/1030054/Marilyn-Monroe?inline=nyt-per" title="">Marilyn Monroe</a> was the sex goddess, <a title="Times slideshow on " href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/05/03/fashion/20100503-grace-slideshow_index.html">Grace Kelly</a> the ice queen, <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/31869/Audrey-Hepburn?inline=nyt-per" title="">Audrey Hepburn</a> the eternal gamine. Ms. Taylor was beauty incarnate. As the director George Stevens said when he chose her for “<a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/gst/movies/titlelist.html?v_idlist=435702;106181;38269&amp;inline=nyt_ttl">A Place in the Sun</a>,”
   the role called for the “beautiful girl in the yellow Cadillac   
convertible that every American boy, some time or other, thinks he can  
 marry.” </p>
  <p> There was more than a touch of Ms. Taylor herself in the roles she
   played. She acted with the magnet of her personality. Although she 
could   alter her look for a part — putting on weight for Martha in 
“Virginia   Woolf” or wearing elaborate period costumes — she was not a 
chameleon,   assuming the coloration of a character. Instead she would 
bring the   character closer to herself. For her, acting was “purely 
intuitive.” As   she said, “What I try to do is to give the maximum 
emotional effect with   the minimum of visual movement.” </p>

  <p> Sometimes her film roles seemed to be a mirror image of her life. 
More   than most movie stars, she seemed to exist in the public domain. 
She was   pursued by paparazzi and denounced by the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/r/roman_catholic_church/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about the Roman Catholic Church.">Vatican</a>.
   But behind the seemingly scandalous behavior was a woman with a clear
   sense of morality: she habitually married her lovers. People watched 
and   counted, with vicarious pleasure, as she became Elizabeth Taylor 
Hilton   Wilding Todd Fisher Burton Burton Warner Fortensky — enough 
marriages   to certify her career as a serial wife. Asked why she 
married so often,   she said, in an assumed drawl: “I don’t know, honey.
 It sure beats the   hell out of me.” </p>
  <p><strong>15. Which of the following is not one of Ms Taylor's married names?</strong></p>

  </p>
  <p>In a lifetime of emotional and physical setbacks, serious illnesses
 and   accidents, and several near-death experiences, Ms. Taylor was a  
 survivor. “I’ve been lucky all my life,” she said just before turning  
 60. “Everything was handed to me. Looks, fame, wealth, honors, love. I 
  rarely had to fight for anything. But I’ve paid for that luck with   
disasters.” At 65, she said on the ABC program “20/20”: “I’m like a   
living example of what people can go through and survive. I’m not like  
 anyone. I’m me.” </p>
  <p> Her life was played out in print: miles of newspaper and magazine 
  articles, a galaxy of photographs and a shelf of biographies, each one
   painting a different portrait. “Planes, trains, everything stops for 
  Elizabeth Taylor, but the public has no conception of who she is,” 
said <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/47310/Roddy-McDowall?inline=nyt-per" title="">Roddy McDowall</a>,
   who was one of her earliest co-stars and a friend for life. “People 
who   damn her wish to hell they could do what they think she does.” </p>

  <p> There was one point of general agreement: her beauty. As cameramen
   noted, her face was flawlessly symmetrical; she had no bad angle, and
   her eyes were of the deepest violet. </p>
  <p> One prominent and perhaps surprising dissenter about her looks was <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/83664/Richard-Burton?inline=nyt-per" title="">Richard Burton</a>,
   who was twice her husband. The notion of his wife as “the most   
beautiful woman in the world is absolute nonsense,” he said. “She has   
wonderful eyes,” he added, “but she has a double chin and an   
overdeveloped chest, and she’s rather short in the leg.” </p>

  <p> On screen and off, Ms. Taylor was a provocative combination of the
 angel   and the seductress. In all her incarnations she had a vibrant  
 sensuality. But beneath it was more than a tinge of vulgarity, as in 
her   love of showy jewelry. “I know I’m vulgar,” she said, addressing 
her   fans with typical candor, “but would you have me any other way?” </p>

  </p>
  <p> For many years she was high on the list of box-office stars. Even 
when   her movies were unsuccessful, or, late in her career, when she 
acted   infrequently, she retained her fame: there was only one Liz (a 
nickname   she hated), and her celebrity increased the more she lived in
 the public   eye. There was nothing she could do about it. “The public 
me,” she   said, “the one named Elizabeth Taylor, has become a lot of 
hokum and   fabrication — a bunch of drivel — and I find her slightly 
revolting.” </p>
  <p> Late in life she became a social activist. After her friend <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/33748/Rock-Hudson?inline=nyt-per" title="">Rock Hudson</a>
 died, she helped establish the American Foundation for AIDS Research   
and helped raise money for it. In 1997, she said, “I use my fame now   
when I want to help a cause or other people.” </p>
