LET'S PROPOSE a   theory. Nothing too new or radical — it is the 
weekend, after all. Let's   just say there are really only two ways of 
looking at things in this   world: from within, and from without. And 
now that we're done with that,   let's talk about bike messengers. </p>
<p> In case you haven't   been in the urban core of any major American 
city for the past few   decades, bike messengers are those toned, 
tattooed daredevils who cut   through exhaust and traffic all day long 
delivering just about anything   that will fit in their shoulder bags: 
legal documents, settlement   checks, X-rays, tax filings, architectural
 plans, silver flatware the   judge has said must now be passed from the
 lawyers for him to the   lawyers for her. </p>

</p>
<p>Who are these people, these men and women who spend their days 
pedaling   inches away from the grills of trucks, swerving around 
shocked   pedestrians and standing, sweaty and smelly and proud of it, 
in   high-rise elevators? </p>
<p></p>
<p> This would seem an   important question to be asking, considering 
that next month, scores of   messengers from around the world are going 
to descend on Seattle for the   Cycle Messenger World Championships, an 
Olympics-style bike-courier   competition. The contests will include 
sprinting, curb-hopping,   cargo-pulling and skidding. </p>
<p><strong>9. What types of vehicles to messengers ride?</strong></p>

</p>
<p> But it turns out that   when it comes to bike messengers, "Who are 
these people?" is actually   not the most important question to be 
asking. Remember the theory. The   most important question is: Who are <em>you</em>, and where are you looking from?
</p>
<p>PERHAPS YOU ARE looking down from the driver's seat of your big, 
green   Chevy Suburban, as was a rather angry man who, while I was 
working as a   bike messenger in downtown Seattle last summer, pulled up
 alongside me   at a stop light and for no apparent reason began 
yelling: "I hate you   messengers!" </p>

</p>
<p>Perhaps you are   looking out from television sets across the city, 
  as was Ken Schram, the   local pundit who last summer went on air and 
  fulminated against "these   cycle-nazis" who "zip inside two lanes of 
  traffic, run red lights and   stop signs, make illegal turns or 
  terrorize pedestrians on the   sidewalk." </p>
<p> Or perhaps you are   not someone with so loud a voice or so wide an 
audience. Perhaps you are   simply someone who has been frightened by a 
zooming messenger while   walking around downtown, or cut off by a 
messenger while driving, or   flipped off by a messenger, or worse. 
Perhaps you are a pedestrian who   has wound up flat on the sidewalk, 
staring at a haze of bike shoes and   piercings and attitude after being
 hit by a messenger (this does happen,   though no firm statistics exist
 on how often). </p>
<p> You see where we are   going. We are now looking at messengers from 
the outside, from the   perspective that many seem to have, the 
perspective that says messengers   are, as Schram put it, "hazardous and
 menacing." <br clear="all">

<p>There is, of course, another way to look at messengers. From within —   
  from behind their handlebars, from atop their pedals, the way I looked  
   at messengers last summer.</p>
<p> From June through   September, I worked for the largest Seattle 
messenger company, ABC   Legal. I earned $9 an hour, the starting salary
 but also not far from as   good as the pay gets. I received no health 
benefits. (According to one   of my managers, ABC is one of just two 
companies downtown that offer   some health benefits, but at ABC you 
have to work a year before you get   them.) I rode the hills, delivered 
the packages, raced to the courthouse   to file the last-minute legal 
papers. I was 24, ready for a break from a   writing job, and hearing 
plenty of advice that I was making a huge   mistake. It turned out to be
 the best summer job I ever had. </p>

</p>
<p> For its brooding   workforce of artists, anarchists, office refugees
 and other assorted   misfits, messengering offers the perfect 
antidepressant cocktail: a   daily dose of  endorphins, regular booster 
shots of adrenaline and fresh   air, plus a new mission every 15 
minutes. The sense of accomplishment   is continual. The highs — from 
caffeine, from the sugar in those little   candies at receptionists' 
desks, from illicit substances that some   messengers partake in  —  are
 perpetual. And the deliveries are stamped   "SPECIAL," a fact that 
seeps into your mind after a while. </p>
<p><br clear="all">

</p>
<p>Jeremy, a muscular 23-year-old whose name among messengers has evolved  
 into a simple growl — "Grrr" — once externalized this seepage by   
stamping the word SPECIAL all over his body. He explains the job's   
allure: </p>
<p></p>
<p> "There's not really   that much at this age that would be better . .
 . I've worked office jobs   before, and I know how much an office job 
can suck. You're basically   just sitting doing mundane stuff all day 
under fluorescent lights. That   basically drains your whole will." </p>
<p> Over the summer, I   got to know Grrr and the other "cycle-nazis," 
people mostly in their 20s   who naturally see themselves a bit 
differently than the outside world   does. About 100 messengers rove 
downtown Seattle for about a dozen   companies, and the ones I met saw 
themselves, first of all, as   blue-collar workers doing a physically 
demanding and dangerous job.    They believe in messengering the way 
lawyers or doctors believe in the   excellence of their occupations. </p>

Their reasons vary. Some just love bikes and thrill at the chance to get
   paid to ride them all day. Others see the trade as the perfect   
anti-corporate, anti-establishment hideout. (Welcome to the first of   
many paradoxes in the bike-messenger business: The very existence of   
this anti-corporate, anti-establishment hideout depends upon the   
existence of corporations and establishments that are sending messages.)
   Still other messengers see their work as an in-your-face reminder to 
  the SUV-driving and car-commuting crowd that there is a more   
eco-friendly way to get around. Finally, many messengers believe in   
their job simply because it is the perfect way to earn a little cash and
   get in shape without stressing yourself so much that you can't think 
  about what's really important, which of course is your band or your 
art   (the overlap between bike messengers and band members is 
considerable).
<p></p>
<p> But if messengers   differ as to why they believe in what they do, 
they tend to agree that   their self-image is defined by the hostility 
they often feel from the   world in which they operate. </p>
<p><strong>15. What is not a reason for messengers to work as messengers?</strong></p>
<p>
  <input name="Submit19" onclick="MM_popupMsg('Wrong, try again!')" value="get paid to ride their bike all day" type="submit">

</p>
<p> A few minutes after   that man in the green Suburban yelled at me, I
 crossed paths with Grrr,   whom I looked to as something of a mentor. 
When I told him what had   happened, he said, "You gotta get used to it.
 People don't like us." </p>
<p> SO WE NOW HAVE two   visions of the bike messenger. Looking in from 
without, we see reckless   miscreants. Looking out from within, we see 
earnest athletes trying to   do a tough job in a hostile environment. It
 is, of course, not that   simple. </p>
<p> There is seeing from   within, and there is seeing from without. But
 there is also this: Two   reasonable people can stand on the same 
outside, look into the same   inside, and see totally different things. </p>

There is the guy in the green Suburban, an outsider who is obviously not a messenger fan.
<p></p>
<p> Then there are the   outsiders like the lawyer in a gray button-down
 shirt I found myself   standing next to at a urinal in a downtown 
office tower. </p>
<p> "Nice day," he said. "Better than all those gloomy winter days, huh?" </p>
<p> I agreed, said something about not looking forward to the rainy season. </p>
<p>"But you guys are   pretty bullet-proof, aren't you?" he said back, 
shooting me a look that I   took to be the highest form of admiration 
one man can safely express   for another in a bathroom. </p>
<p> Yes, I nodded, we are bullet-proof. <br clear="all">
  <br clear="all">
</p>
<p>And then there is Jack Dennerlein, an outsider who also happens to be
 a   professor of ergonomics and safety at the Harvard School of Public 
  Health. Dennerlein always admired messengers. "I have to admit that   
that's why I studied them," he says. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>17. Why did Dr. Dennerlein study bike messengers?</strong></p>
<p>
  <input name="Submit19" onclick="MM_popupMsg('Wrong, try again!')" value="He's a safety expert" type="submit">

  <input name="Submit32" onclick="MM_popupMsg('YAY, you\'re correct')" value="He admired messengers." type="submit">
</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Last year Dennerlein   and another Harvard researcher, John Meeker, 
released the results of   their study of occupational injuries among 113
 bike messengers in   Boston. No similar study has been done here, and 
the Washington   Department of Labor and Industries doesn't have good 
data on injuries   reported specifically by bike couriers. </p>
<p> But the size of   Boston and its messenger community is roughly 
comparable to Seattle. The   study there found high rates of injuries — 
greater than rates for the   meat-packing industry. And anecdotal 
evidence in Seattle suggests high   rates of injury here, too. </p>
<p> "Everyone's time comes," a local rider named Brent told me with typical fatalism. "I've got scars all over me from being hit." </p>

<p> Last summer I saw a   downtown biker dazed and bleeding after having
 gone through the back   window of a car. I heard horror stories of 
being pinned between Metro   buses, saw legs gouged by pedals, noticed 
the regular occurrence of   casts, bandages and limps. I heard about the
 messenger who, in June   2000, was killed by a motorist. </p>
<p> In this environment,   "wrecking" is almost a rite of passage. One 
of the times I felt most   embraced by the messengers was when I showed 
up for work on a Monday   sporting bruises and road rash from having 
crashed during a weekend   ride. Joe, a dashing messenger with so little
 body fat his veins look   like snakes slithering beneath his skin, came
 over to take a look at the   hard crust forming over my scrapes. "Yeah,
 scabbers!" he said, smiling   warmly. <br clear="all">

The Boston study painted a profile of the city's courier class:
<p></p>
<p> The average age of   those surveyed was 27, and most were men. They 
averaged 28 deliveries a   day. Ninety percent said they had been 
injured on the job at some point.   The most common cause of injury was 
collision with a motor vehicle; the   least common was collision with a 
pedestrian. </p>
<p> Given the numbers,   one surprising finding was that only 24 percent
 of the Boston messengers   wore helmets. In Seattle, only some 
messenger companies require   helmets, and many messengers ride without 
them. Yet most of the Boston   messengers surveyed, and many in Seattle,
 say their job is quite risky.   Another paradox. </p>
<p><strong>19. What event happened in 2000 in Seattle?</strong></p>
<p>
  <input name="Submit19" onclick="MM_popupMsg('Wrong, try again!')" value="Messengers have to wear helmets" type="submit">

</p>
<p> The findings on   helmet use seem to support the idea that bike 
messengers tend to be   risk-takers — or, if you are feeling less 
charitable, idiots. Trouble   is, the study didn't assess who was at 
fault in the accidents or who   else was injured. So the data can be 
used to support either the view   that messengers are reckless or that 
they are victims of a hostile   environment. <br clear="all">
  <br clear="all">
</p>
<p>DENNERLEIN WAS aware of the different ways messengers are seen, but 
he   tried to take an objective look. Perhaps their aggressive 
on-the-road   behavior was a sort of Darwinian adaptation. </p>
