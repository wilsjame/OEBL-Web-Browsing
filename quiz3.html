Camille Richardson has heard all the arguments, read all the 
comments, and sees the logic. But as a freshman midfielder for the <a href="http://www.gocolumbialions.com/SportSelect.dbml?SPID=3879&amp;DB_OEM_ID=9600" title="The team’s Web site.">Columbia women’s lacrosse team</a>
 who is fully aware of the dangers of head trauma, Richardson makes one 
  thing clear: She has no interest in wearing a helmet, as the men must.
 </p>
  <p> “Wearing a helmet,” Richardson said, “would just bring us closer to football and hockey.” </p>
  <p> Although some safety advocates call for head protection in women’s
   lacrosse, almost everyone involved in the sport has said that its   
current ban on helmets for everyone but goaltenders is actually the   
safest approach. Hockey safety experts question if helmets foster more  
 physical play. Football looks back and wonders whether big face masks  
 encouraged a recklessness that can lead to long-term brain damage. </p>

<p> Now at its own crossroad, women’s lacrosse — with 250,000 playing   
nationwide — wants to take the road less battered. And so begins the   
second stage of sports’ continuing parry with head injuries — in which  
 the best protection, many experts insist, is no protection at all. </p>
  <p> “It’s hard to absolutely prove, but what we’ve seen is that 
behavior can   change when athletes feel more protected, especially when
 it comes to   the head and helmets,” said Dr. Margot Putukian, 
Princeton’s director of   athletic medicine services and chairwoman of 
the <a href="http://www.uslacrosse.org/" title="The Web site.">U.S. Lacrosse</a>
 safety committee. “They tend to put their bodies and heads in danger   
that they wouldn’t without the protection. And they aren’t as protected 
  as they might think.” </p>
  <p> Although boys’ lacrosse rules mandate helmets and face masks at 
all age   levels, girls’ lacrosse, whose season at many schools begins 
this month,   is drastically different. Amy Bokker, Stanford’s women’s 
coach, only   half-jokingly says that it shouldn’t be called lacrosse at
 all. </p>
  <p> Girls at all levels cannot body check; collisions are minimized. </p>
  <p> Contact with the head is so off limits that accidental intrusion 
with   stick or body within seven inches of the head — an area known as 
the   halo — is a major foul. Even shooting with a defender in line with
 the   goal is illegal. </p>

  <p>&nbsp;  </p>
  <p> Even so, girls’ lacrosse does see its share of concussions, mostly
 on   accidental stick-to-head contact, collisions and falls. According 
to   research by Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, not 
only   does the sport have the third-highest rate of concussion among 
female   scholastic sports (behind soccer and basketball), but its 
in-game rate   is only about 15 percent less than the rougher male 
version. </p>
  <p> Research suggests that even though men’s lacrosse helmets are 
required   only to eliminate skull fracture and intracranial bleeding — 
like   football helmets — the headgear is probably decreasing the 
concussion   rate to some extent. Yet as recently as December, the New 
York State   Public High School Athletic Association voted by 9 to 2 to 
continue   banning hard helmets in the women’s game, a stance echoed by 
U.S.   Lacrosse. </p>
  <p> Not everyone agrees with that decision. </p>
  <p> “Any time we can prevent a concussion, we should try to do it,” said Dr. Brian Rieger, director of the <a href="http://www.upstate.edu/uh/pmr/concussion/sports/" title="The Web site.">Central New York Sports Concussion Center</a>,
   who has shared his feelings with U.S. Lacrosse. “Even though it’s   
usually a short-lived event, there are certain situations, I’ve seen it,
   where even a kid with one concussion can be out of school for weeks 
or   months, and struggle. When you see a child or parent go through it,
 it   makes me feel we should do anything to prevent it.” </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> At the annual meeting last month of the National Organizing 
Committee on   Standards for Athletic Equipment, or Nocsae, which sets 
performance   standards for almost all organized sports’ safety gear, 
one of the most   heated exchanges concerned U.S. Lacrosse’s continued 
ban on hard helmets   and face guards. Dr. Jack Ryan, representing the <a href="http://www.sportsmed.org/tabs/Index.aspx" title="The Web site.">American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine</a>,
   complained: “Somebody’s got to stand up and say, What are you doing? 
  This to me is like, come on, you’re not serious. This is 2011.” </p>
  <p> Then again, other sports have spent the last several years 
realizing   that safety equipment can bring dangers of its own. Checking
 in   professional hockey became considerably more vicious with the 
adoption   of helmets in the 1970s and ’80s, and football players felt 
so protected   by their helmets and face masks that head-to-head 
collisions became   commonplace at every age level. Scaling back 
protection now in order to   dissuade violent play would be too 
dangerous, experts say, both   physically and legally. </p>
  <p> Even though women’s lacrosse rules against contact would be 
unchanged or   even strengthened with the adoption of helmets, the ethos
 would almost   certainly change, more than a dozen coaches, players and
 officials said   in interviews. One of Camille Richardson’s teammates 
at Columbia, the   senior attacker Olivia Mann, said that after the move
 to make eyewear   mandatory for the 2005 season, “It’s subconscious, 
but you see harder   checking, and rougher play.” </p>
  <p><strong>15. Eyewear became mandatory in what season? </strong></p>
  <p>
    <input name="Submit44" onclick="MM_popupMsg('Wrong, try again!')" value="2004" type="submit">

    <input name="Submit44" onclick="MM_popupMsg('Sorry, Try again.')" value="1999" type="submit">
  </p>
  <p> Richardson and Mann gladly demonstrated what they see helmets 
doing to   their sport. As Mann played defense and Richardson cradled 
the ball with   her head up, the women used their feet to grab position 
and cut. </p>
  <p> The term, they explained, was to “wrong-foot” your opponent. </p>
  <p> They were then asked to pretend they were wearing helmets. Without
   knowing it, solely on instinct, Mann violated the halo rule by 
swinging   her stick close to Richardson’s head. This was partly because
   Richardson, feeling protected, slightly dipped her head and leaned in
   toward, rather than away, from contact. </p>
  <p><strong>16. What rule was violated when a stick is swung close to the opponent's head? </strong></p>
  <p>
    <input name="Submit44" onclick="MM_popupMsg('Yay, correct!')" value="Halo" type="submit">
    <input name="Submit45" onclick="MM_popupMsg('sorry, try again')" value="Offsides" type="submit">
    <input name="Submit44" onclick="MM_popupMsg('Sorry, Try again.')" value="Stickspace" type="submit">
  </p>
  <p> “I would be more likely to take risky checks, which would change 
the   nature of defense completely,” Mann said. “Now, trying not to foul
 her,   it’s very much about where I get my hands and body. If she’s 
wearing a   helmet, I don’t have to worry about physically injuring her.
 I’m more   likely to sacrifice my body positioning to get at her 
stick.” </p>
  <p> Another teammate, Kelly Buechel, said, “You want someone to beat 
you   because they’re more skilled than you, not because they’re more 
brutal   than you.” </p>
  <p> Mouth guards and eye guards are required in women’s lacrosse. And 
the   rules have for decades allowed soft headgear — usually a headband 
or a   crown of soft padding, borrowed from kickboxing or elsewhere. But
 these   go essentially unused because players consider them either 
unnecessary   or ugly. (Web sites for three women’s lacrosse equipment 
outlets don’t   list any sort of head protection for sale.) The rare 
women’s player who   does wear the soft headgear, experts said, usually 
has a prior head   injury and is feeling more protected than she 
actually is. </p>
  <p> In November, U.S. Lacrosse did accede and approach Nocsae about   
developing a standard for some form of head protection for women —   
almost certainly soft — that might protect against some stick-to-head   
concussions. Nocsae officials at the annual meeting recommended at least
   hard face masks, if not helmets, and somewhat grudgingly accepted the
   assignment. </p>
  <p> The U.S. Lacrosse president, Steve Stenersen, said that during 
this age   of concussion awareness in youth sports, he opposed any 
headgear that   would, he said, “upset the balance between safety and 
game integrity, or   bring some unintended consequence.” </p>
  <p> “Everybody looks at equipment intervention as the end-all, be-all —
 but   it’s not, and the football discussion bears that out,” Stenersen 
said.   He added that U.S. Lacrosse would rather emphasize education and
 rules   enforcement and keep the game unchanged. </p>
  <p> “People are less focused on those because they’re less tangible, 
and the   picture of a helmet on a kid makes them feel better,” he said.
 “But   it’s much more complicated than that.” </p>
